       <string>1. I have the machine learning (ML) in the third year, plus 4 seminar&#13;
groups:&#13;
&#13;
- I would like the course to precede my seminars ;&#13;
&#13;
- I would like very much to not take hours Mondays and Tuesdays (when&#13;
preparing the course of that week;&#13;
&#13;
- I can not keep hours in the morning from 8 to 10 (morning revives me hard&#13;
... I got older);&#13;
&#13;

&#13;

same day), and seminars will be grouped 2 in a row, so I will have &quot;to work&#13;
4 hours in a row when coming to FII).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2. In regards to my collaborators, ie people who will hold seminars on this&#13;
subject:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Stefan A. Pantiru (computer, external collaborator)&#13;
&#13;
- Has 4 seminar groups and wants to have classes grouped (2 each seminar,&#13;
so 4 hours) or morning between 8-12, or in the evening between the hours of&#13;
16 to 20;&#13;
&#13;
- NOT hold classes on Wednesdays.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
B. Tiberius Dumitru (assistant, PhD., UT &quot;Gh.&quot;)&#13;
&#13;
- Has 2 seminar groups; He wants to keep his classes Friday evening&#13;
(16-20); has a very busy schedule at UT &quot;Gh.,&quot; very much so please try to&#13;
keep in mind his option.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
C. There are 5 more seminar groups; it will be all hold by freelancers, so&#13;
you should put all them in the morning (4 hours) or evening (4 hours).&#13;
Later today or tomorrow I will indicate the names of these employees (I am&#13;
negotiating with them, but I did not take the final decision yet).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
3. The problem of a &quot;special seminar&quot; on the machine learning to come to&#13;
the best students in the third year.&#13;
&#13;
I guess the lack of resources (time available halls and timetable) such a&#13;
seminar can not be put in zone sometime else than Saturday or another day&#13;
but only in the evening after 20 o&apos;clock ,so I should discuss with students&#13;
at the course in the first week and decide. For now you can pass it on&#13;
Saturday mornings (but not at 8).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
IMPORTANT:&#13;
&#13;
I prefer courses room 309 and possibly 112.&#13;
&#13;
Also prefer special seminar room 309.&#13;
&#13;
In general, for my seminars I prefer rooms with two tables, but they are&#13;
few, far as I know ... I do not know how occupied is the room 2010, but I&apos;d&#13;
probably like to hold seminars there.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
I (LC): 3 groups + &quot;special seminar&quot;&#13;
&#13;
Restrictions: Do not months, Tuesday, and in the other day from 8 am NOT.&#13;
&#13;
Preferences: my seminars to be made after the course (in the same week)&#13;
&#13;
&quot;Special Seminar&quot; can be placed between the hours 20-21: 40&#13;
(Wednesday-Friday) or Saturday from 10am. I urge C309. (Of course, if you&#13;
can put sometime Wednesday-Friday between 10 to 20 I will not refuse.)&#13;

In semester 1 , I have:&#13;
1 course at MSI2 Security Software + MISS2 (preferably seminar room&#13;

laptop + video)&#13;
1 Security Software Laboratory in MISS2 (room laboratory&#13;
laptop + video)&#13;
2 laboratories of Information Security at Year 3 (laboratory room)&#13;
-------------------------------------------------- -------------------&#13;
&#13;
That restriction, masks COURSE I want to be preferable from Tuesday&#13;
8-10; if you can not Tuesday at 8, then Tuesday 10-12 or 16-18.&#13;
&#13;
2 LABORATORIES masks: if the course is set in the morning (8-10 or 10-12),&#13;
laboratories I want to be grouped in one day on 16-20. If&#13;
the course is set at 16, I&apos;d like a laboratory after class and one in a&#13;
8 morning.&#13;
&#13;
2 LABORATORIES information security from 3rd year I want to be made&#13;
grouped as possible with the other hours.&#13;

In semester 1 , I have:&#13;
1 course at MSI2 Security Software + MISS2 (preferably seminar room&#13;
C901 or C909 with laptop + video because there is better seen in video)&#13;
1 Security Software Laboratory in MSI2 (room laboratory&#13;
laptop + video)&#13;
1 Security Software Laboratory in MISS2 (room laboratory&#13;
laptop + video)&#13;
2 laboratories of Information Security at Year 3 (laboratory room)&#13;
-------------------------------------------------- -------------------&#13;
&#13;
That restriction, masks COURSE I want to be preferable from Tuesday&#13;
8-10; if you can not Tuesday at 8, then Tuesday 10-12 or 16-18.&#13;
&#13;
2 LABORATORIES masks: if the course is set in the morning (8-10 or 10-12),&#13;
laboratories I want to be grouped in one day on 16-20. If&#13;
the course is set at 16, I&apos;d like a laboratory after class and one in a&#13;
8 morning.&#13;
&#13;
2 LABORATORIES information security from 3rd year I want to be made&#13;
grouped as possible with the other hours.&#13;
&#13;
I do not want hours after 16:00 but only once a week.&#13;

4 laboratories of Computer Architecture and Operating Systems.&#13;

I do not want hours on Friday or Saturday.&#13;
&#13;
Ideal version:&#13;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  One laboratory every day, from 08:00&#13;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  (I know there are courses in the morning on Monday and Tuesday, so it&apos;s probably difficult to satisfy this constraint)&#13;
Optimal version:&#13;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Hours from 8:00 or 18:00, but the priority is from 08:00.&#13;
